            We are proud to announce our least lucrative idea to date,
            <a href="/library.html">The Galaxy Brain Printing Library</a>.
            In accordance with our library socialist ideals, we are
            experimentally providing free Risograph and 3D printing
            services to our neighbors in the Bay Area.

    <h2>Our Work</h2>
    <p>
        We make everything from zines about wine to telephony apps for
        podcasters. You can see the full set of what we do on our
        <a href="/projects.html">Projects page</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We also partner with other folks to publish their zines, print
        their art, and make things happen. It&rsquo;s all available on
        our store.
