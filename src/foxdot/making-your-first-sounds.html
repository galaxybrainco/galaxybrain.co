        <h1>Opening the FoxDot Editor</h1>
        <p>
            Congratulations on getting FoxDot installed – let’s make some
            sounds! First you need to open SuperCollider so that we can load up
            sounds from FoxDot. Once SuperCollider opens, type the following
            into the editor:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">FoxDot.start
</code></pre>
        <p>
            This tells SuperCollider to start listening for messages from
            FoxDot. To run this line of code you need put your text cursor on
            the line and press <code>Ctrl+Return</code>. The line should flash
            and you should see some numbers turn green in the bottom of your
            screen:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                alt="SuperCollider Boot Up"
                src="/web/20210408161919im_/https://foxdot.org/static/images/docs/sc_bootup.png"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we can open the FoxDot editor and begin making sounds. You can
            open the editor by going to your command line application (Command
            Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac and Linux) and typing in the
            following bit of code and pressing enter:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">$ python -m FoxDot
</code></pre>
        <p>
            This tells your computer to run the Python interpreter and run the
            FoxDot module as a standalone script. You should be greeted with a
            window that looks something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                alt="FoxDot Editor"
                src="/web/20210408161919im_/https://foxdot.org/static/images/docs/foxdot_editor.png"
            />
        </p>
        <h1>Evaluating Code</h1>
        <p>
            What you have here is an interactive text editor; you can write code
            but also run the code within the editor itself. To execute a block
            of code (lines not separated by blank lines) make sure your text
            cursor is in the block of code you want to evaluate and press
            <code>Ctrl+Enter</code> on Windows/Linux or
            <code>Command+Return</code> on Mac. The text should flash red for a
            brief moment and be printed to the console on the bottom of the
            screen like so:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                alt="FoxDot editor with code execution"
                src="/web/20210408161919im_/https://foxdot.org/static/images/docs/foxdot_editor.png"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s make a simple noise. Type the following into the FoxDot editor
            and evaluate it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">p1 &gt;&gt; pluck()
</code></pre>
        <p>
            This should start a very basic loop playing one plucked note on
            repeat. To stop this, add <code>.stop()</code> to the end of the
            line so it looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">p1 &gt;&gt; pluck().stop()
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Evaluate the line to stop the loop. There you go! You’ve made sound
            with FoxDot – have a look at the rest of the “Getting Started”
            section to get to grips with other aspects of the environment before
            moving onto the advanced sections… and have fun!
