        Being able to transform sequences of values is an important part of
        algorithmic music and can be a powerful compositional tool when applied
        at various points in a performance. One of the easiest ways to<br />
        do this in FoxDot is using the <code>Player.every()</code> method to
        apply these transformations at regular intervals.
