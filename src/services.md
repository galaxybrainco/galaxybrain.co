# Stuff we like to do

* Risograph printing (it's totally free for folks near us, up to a limit)
* 3D printing (again, totally free for our neighbors with small projects)
* Audio production (we produce our own podcasts, and some others)
* Music on commission (we write theme songs!)
* Software design and implementation (if you twist our arm about it, and/or you have an idea that is so bonkers we want it to exist as much as you)

  <p>
  We love to collaborate with folks and we're available for hire for all of our core competencies (and hell, we&rsquo;ll learn for neat ideas). 
  Our rates are incredibly variable, and occasionally nonexistent.
  No matter what stage you're at with your project, we want to hear from you.
