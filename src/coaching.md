<p>Managing is hard. Being creative is hard. But they are not impossible. Managing a team and managing your own creativity are pure human behaviors, and as a human you have the tools you need to be the best manager you can be.<p>
<p>Knowing how to use those tools effectively is where we come in. Galaxy Brain Coaching wants to use our decades of hard-earned lessons on your behalf, helping you create resilient management structures for your team and for yourself, and developing your own philosophy and practice around management.<p>

  I worked with [Philip] to answer one of the hardest questions I've had to grapple with at work, and [he] immediately condensed it into "Here are some things you should keep in mind. Here are some warning signs that things are going wrong. Here are some landmines that somebody, not necessarily you, is going to step on, and here's what you should think about before that happens. Here are the positive sides of this situation, even though it's lousy, and these are some things you want to make sure you internalize from everything." And the wild thing is, [he was] completely right about everything.

## Who we are

We're <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phildini/">Philip James</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemarydotworld/">Rosemary Campbell</a>, two Bay Area natives who have stood astride the intersection of technology, arts, and leadership for multiple decades. We have run engineering teams, run engineering organizations, managed creative projects, produced podcasts and zines and music and webcomics, and studied with industry leaders across the country on how to do all of this as in the most human way possible. We want to share that with you.
