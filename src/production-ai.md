Your AI prototype actually works. Users love it. Your demo kills in every meeting.

But between "works on my laptop" and "handles paying customers" lies the graveyard of brilliant AI projects. 99% of AI prototypes never make it to production. Not because the AI was wrong, but because the engineering was missing.

Galaxy Brain specializes in the one thing everyone else avoids: turning working AI prototypes into bulletproof production systems. Without breaking what makes them magical.

  <h2 class="news-container-header">The Problem</h2>
  <div class="news-container-body">
  <p>
  Most dev shops run from AI prototypes. The work is messy—part forensic engineering, part system architecture, part business strategy. It demands someone who understands both what you built and what you actually need to build.
  </p>
  <p>
  We live in this exact chaos. We take working AI prototypes and transform them into production systems that scale, perform, and make money. While keeping the magic intact.

## What We Do

**Prototype Forensics**
We dive deep into what you built to understand why it works. AI-generated code is often brilliant but fragile. We identify the genius worth keeping and the chaos that needs fixing.

**Production Infrastructure**
Bulletproof deployment with monitoring, error handling, and security that won't crumble under real traffic. Battle-tested architecture, not over-engineered monuments.

**Scale-Ready Engineering**
Database design, API architecture, authentication, performance optimization. The boring foundation work that lets your breakthrough idea handle real users and real money.

**Strategic Technical Leadership**
Every line of code is a business decision. We help you prioritize what builds value and avoid the technical debt that kills startups.

  <h2 class="news-container-header">Our Process</h2>
  <div class="news-container-body">
  
  **1. Prototype Deep Dive**
  We spelunk your prototype to understand what you built and why it works. This means reverse-engineering the logic, mapping the data flow, and separating brilliance from chaos.

  **2. Production Architecture**
  We design the production system for your actual needs and realistic growth. No over-engineering. No cutting corners. Just solid systems that scale.

  **3. Sprint Development**
  Short cycles, weekly demos, constant feedback. You see real progress every week and we adapt as we learn what actually matters.

  **4. Knowledge Transfer**
  We don't just deploy and vanish. Complete documentation, training, and ongoing support until you're confident running and growing the system yourself.

## Why Galaxy Brain

**AI Systems Expertise**
I know how LLMs work and where they break. I've shipped AI features to production and debugged the specific nightmares of AI-generated code—the inconsistencies, edge cases, and magic that stops working at 3 AM.

**Battle-Tested Engineering**
<a href=https://linkedin.com/in/phildini>Decade+</a> in <a href="/coaching">engineering leadership</a>, AWS certified, core contributor to open source projects like BeeWare. I've guided dozens of prototypes to production and burned into my brain all the ways they can fail.

**Business-First Thinking**
Every technical decision is a business bet. I've lived the full journey from prototype to shipped product. I know how to balance moving fast with building something that lasts.

## Get Started

Your AI prototype works. Your users are demanding access. Your investors are asking about scale.

Don't let engineering be the thing that kills your breakthrough. Let's turn your prototype into a production system that makes money.
