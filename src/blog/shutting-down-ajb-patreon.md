Hello! This message is too long in coming. It is obvious that we have abandoned the [Adult Juice Box Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/adultjuicebox). What is unclear to anyone who isn’t myself and [Rosemary](http://rosemary.world) is the future of Adult Juice Box, and especially [Thought & A Chaser](https://pod.link/thoughtchaser).

So, let’s talk about it!

First! 

- Those ideas are not dead. Our desire to talk about, write about, design about, and of course *drink* weird alcohol remains afloat.
- We still have projects “in the chamber” for both Adult Juice Box and Thought & A Chaser. There’s two whole frankly-wild episodes for T&AC that are recorded, and just need to be edited, so don’t unsubscribe!
- We’re putting T&AC on hiatus once those episodes are released. We realized sometime over last year that it started feeling like work to put together episodes, and the more it felt like work the less we would do it. So we’re pausing, and regrouping, and thinking about what we want to do next with Thought & A Chaser.

Second!

- [Galaxy Brain](https://galaxybrain.co/), the creative studio we built to hold projects like Adult Juice Box, is not dead. We’re doing weirder and wilder stuff constantly, and making it available any way we can.
- If you like T&AC, you’ll probably love [Brain Tape](http://pod.link/braintape), our newest podcast project where we dive deep into the Achewood webcomic.
- If you want to create things with us, and you live in San Francisco or Alameda County, you can do so for free through the [Galaxy Brain Printing Library](https://galaxybrain.co/library.html).
- We’re gearing up to do more projects in publishing, and more projects in video, and more projects in audio, so please stay tuned.

Third, and last!

- Thank you from the bottom of our chalices for all your support on this journey. We started this Patreon to get our creative dreams off the ground, and you were instrumental in that. Your name is forever etched in the Galaxy Brain Pantheon. For many of you it will soon be etched into our risograph, Animal, in recognition of your contributions over the years. Pictures will be sent out as soon as that happens.
- You might have noticed we didn’t collect your pledge this month. We never will again, from this Patreon! If you would still like to support Galaxy Brain, and our ongoing creative work, you can do so from our [Support](http://galaxybrain.co/support) page. This isn’t intended as a goodbye, it’s more a “We’ve moved!”
- If you think we owe you anything for being a patron, you’re probably right, and you should email us at hello@galaybrain.co to tell us what we owe you and we’ll send it along if we have it. This can include wine recommendations.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. We say it three times, and it is true, and where one chapter ends a new one begins.

Philip & Rosemary.
