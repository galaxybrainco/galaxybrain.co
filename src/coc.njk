    <h2>Full Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any
        Galaxy Brain event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this
        code throughout the event.</p>
    <h3>What we value</h3>
    <p>We value the participation of each member of the Galaxy Brain community and want all attendees to have an
        enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to
        other attendees throughout the event, at all related events, and in all event online spaces (such as Slack),
        whether officially sponsored by Galaxy Brain or not.</p>
    <h3>Be Kind To Others</h3>
    <p>Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist,
        racist,
        or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Galaxy Brain. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
        leave the event without a refund at the sole discretion of the event organizers.</p>
    <h3>Be Respectful</h3>
    <p>Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We
        do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.</p>
    <p>Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
        intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or
        other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
    <h3>Choose Your Words</h3>
    <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be
        offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Galaxy Brain.
        We are all adults, capable of having adult conversations.</p>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
    <p>Exhibitors or vendors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
