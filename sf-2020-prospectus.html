                Galaxy Brain, a publishing company and print shop in North
                Beach, San Francisco, is holding its first gallery show from
                April to May of 2020. Hosted at
                <a href="https://www.mulegallery.com/">Mule Gallery</a> in North
                Beach, Galaxy Brain is looking for artists and creators to
                submit pieces around the theme of:
            </p>
            <h1 class="prospectus-title">
                The San Francisco that Could Be
            </h1>
            <p>
                We’re looking for stories and pieces about alternate versions of
                San Francisco’s past, present, and future. We’re especially
                interested in pieces centering the perspectives of communities
                that have been marginalized, pushed out, or forced to adapt for
                survival. Extra consideration will be given to pieces that
                creatively utilize print, and accepted submissions will have
                access to our Risograph print shop, including all the ink,
                paper, and assistance we can provide.

                We’re looking for zines, art prints, paintings, installations,
                games, poetry, spoken word pieces, and short theater works. If
                you think you have a piece that could fit what we’re looking
                for, please submit it. Submissions are due Friday March 6th,
                2020, at 6pm. The Gallery Opening will be Friday, April 3rd,
                2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll happily facilitate the sale of any original pieces in the
                show, and we highly encourage using our Risograph to make prints
                and zines to sell during our entire residency in the space, as
                well as on our online store, if you like. We’re committed to
                finding ways to help your work reach more people and make you
                more money.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have a limited ability to pay materials stipends, please
                let us know if that would be the difference between submitting
                and not.

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>
                How do I make a submission?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Send an email to
                <a href="mailto:hello@galaxybrain.co">hello@galaxybrain.co</a>
                and make it clear that you’re submitting a piece for the show.
                Describe the piece in as much detail as you can, and tell us
                what you would need to make it a reality. This is not a
                closed-envelope situation, it’s the start of a conversation.
                <br />Don’t worry too much.
            </p>

            <h3>
                When will I know if my piece has been accepted?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We will do our best to respond to all submissions within 48
                hours to let you know we’ve received the submission. We’ll send
                out acceptances no later than March 13th.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Does it only have to be about San Francisco?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Your piece should definitely focus on the San Francisco Bay
                Area, but doesn’t have to be specifically San Francisco.
