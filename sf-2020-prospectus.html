                The Ephemeral Bookshop
            </h1>
            <p>
                In April and May of 2020, a unique bookshop will open at
                <a href="https://www.mulegallery.com/">Mule Gallery</a> in North
                Beach. It will almost certainly disappear soon after. Like the
                common fruit fly, it is destined for a short and confusing life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shop will be filled with work that invites a Bay Area that
                is stranger, kinder, more colorful, and more inclusive. We are
                looking for authors, artists, cartoonists, poets, game
                designers, etc. to fill our shelves and displays. We are also
                (very) open to hearing about events you think our shop could put
                on. For instance: readings, rituals, panels, salons, or
                experimental theater. If you have an idea, we’ll give you our
                time, our attention, our ink, our paper, and our counsel —&nbsp;if you
                want it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope you’ll consider putting your work in our shop,
                especially/even if:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You are not a straight white man.</li>
                <li>You’ve never worked in print before.</li>
                <li>You think this sounds weird.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We’ll happily facilitate the sale of any original pieces in the
                show, and we highly encourage using our Risograph to make prints
                and zines to sell during our entire residency in the space, as
                well as on our online store, if you like. We’re committed to
                finding ways to help your work reach more people and make you
                more money. Accepted submissions will have access to our
                Risograph print shop, including all the ink, paper, and
                assistance we can provide.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also have a limited ability to pay materials stipends, please
                don’t let needing funds stop you from submitting.
            </p>
            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>
                How do I make a submission?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Send an email to
                <a href="mailto:hello@galaxybrain.co">hello@galaxybrain.co</a>
                and make it clear that you’re submitting a piece for the shop.
                Describe the piece in as much detail as you can, and tell us
                what you would need to make it a reality. This is not a
                closed-envelope situation, it’s the start of a conversation.
                <br />Don’t worry too much.
            </p>

            <h3>
                When will I know if my piece has been accepted?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We will do our best to respond to all submissions within 48
                hours to let you know we’ve received the submission. We’ll send
                out acceptances no later than March 13th.
