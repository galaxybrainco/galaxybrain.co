These instructions are meant to give you an impression of what the day&rsquo;s going to be like, which should help you have a good time. Good times are our business. This is not meant to be homework; We don&rsquo;t believe in homework. </p> <p> What we <em>do</em> believe in is what artist Corita Kent called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1twViglf1T/">&ldquo;plork&rdquo;</a>. With plork, you get to have fun <em>and</em> feel accomplished when you&rsquo;re done. Let&rsquo;s get to plork! </p> <h2>What&rsquo;s Going to Happen?</h2> <p>Here&rsquo;s our entire agenda:</p> <ol> <li> Philip and Liam greet you and pour you a drink. Philip knows a lot about wine and will likely have some bottles on hand, if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing. </li> <li> Liam shows you how the Risograph works, answers your questions, and shows you some cool prints made by us and others for inspiration and edification. </li> <li> You print an image you&rsquo;ve brought, and/or you make something interesting to print. You experiment. We help out, advise, and pour. </li> <li> You go home with a couple dozen or so prints of your own. You feel great, hopefully. </li> </ol> <h2>What Can I Print?</h2> <p>A lot of things! Here are your constraints:</p> <ul> <li> Our Riso prints on paper up to 8.5"x14", and most of our paper stock is 8.5"x11". </li> <li> Our ink colors are Federal Blue, Bright Red, Green, Yellow, and Black. You can mix them on a single print for lots of tones. <a href="http://stencil.wiki/colors">Here&rsquo;s a handy reference</a> on Risograph ink colors. </li> <li> Due to the way Risography works, you need to separate each color into a layer on its own so it can receive a separate ink pass. If you&rsquo;ve ever done screen printing, this will be familiar. </li> </ul> <p> Small art prints will work great, and if you&rsquo;re ambitious you can get away with making a single-sheet folded zine. </p> <p> Given the time constraint, you&rsquo;ll have the most success with two or three colors at most. But, if you&rsquo;ve got a cool idea that requires more, let&rsquo;s talk about it. We&rsquo;re here to help. </p> <h2>Can I See Some Examples?</h2> <p>Gosh, yes. Instagram is a great resource for this:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/galaxybrainco/">Our Instagram</a> is full of example prints. </li> <li> Our Risograph heroes also have feeds that you might want to check out: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/diskettepress/">Diskette Press</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/risolve/">Risolve</a>, and <a href="#">Perfectly Acceptable</a>. </li> <li>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/risograph/"><em>#risograph</em> tag</a> can be pretty rad sometimes, too.</li> </ul> <h2>What&rsquo;s a Risograph, Exactly?</h2> <p>The pithy answer is, it&rsquo;s a humble duplicator (like a photocopier) that can be tricked into becoming an amazing art tool.</p> <p>A more useful answer is, it&rsquo;s an automated screen printer that uses unique stencil and ink techniques to create handmade-looking prints automatically.</p> <p>For a truly accurate answer, check out <a href="https://www.risologyclub.com/what-is-risograph">Risology Club&rsquo;s explanation.</a></p> <h2>By The Way</h2> <p> We have a <a href="/coc.html">code of conduct</a> for folk who attend events with us. It&rsquo;s straightforward and pretty standard, but important nonetheless. </p> </main> <script src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@4.5.10-0/dist/ionicons.js"></script> </body></html>
