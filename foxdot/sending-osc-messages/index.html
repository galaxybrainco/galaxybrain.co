            Open Sound Control (OSC) is a digital music communication protocol
            and is becoming more and more prevalent in modern audio software.
            Applications using OSC will have a server listening for messages
            from a client – this is how FoxDot communicates with SuperCollider
            to generate audio. Here’s a quick run through of how to send these
            messages to other OSC applications from FoxDot.
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s really simple; you just need to tell FoxDot to “forward” any
            OSC messages. Let’s say your application is running on the local
            host on port 12345, here’s the code for connecting to it:
        </p>

        <div>
            <div id="highlighter_298242" class="syntaxhighlighter python">
                <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="code">
                                <div class="container">
                                    <div class="line number1 index0 alt2">
                                        <code class="python plain"
                                            >Server.add_forward(</code
                                        ><code class="python string"
                                            >"localhost"</code
                                        ><code class="python plain">, </code
                                        ><code class="python value">12345</code
                                        ><code class="python plain">)</code>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            And that’s it! Any time FoxDot sends an OSC message to
            SuperCollider, it will also send it to the other OSC application
            too. These messages are usually sent as a group together called an
            “OSC Bundle” which contain a message about the note being played,
            and also a message for each effect being applied. Here’s what the
            note message looks like:
        </p>

        <p>
            <code
                >[address, synth-name, synth-id, add-action, target-id, arg-1,
                value-1, arg-2, value-2, ...]</code
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            The “address” is basically the name of the function that the OSC
            application should process the rest of the message with; for
            SuperCollider this is usually <code>/s_new</code> and means “trigger
            synth” and the “synth-name” is name of the SynthDef being triggered.
            The “synth-id”, “add-action” and “target-id” values relate
            specifically to SuperCollider so your application can probably
            ignore these. Then come the arguments used, such as frequency and
            amplitude, which are written in turn and separated by commas. Here’s
            what a typical messages might look like
        </p>

        <p>
            <code
                >["/s_new", "pluck", 1001, 1, 0, "freq", 440, "amp", 1, "pan",
                -1, "sus", 1]
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            So a “pluck” synth is creating a note with an amplitude of 1 at a
            frequency of 440Hz with a sustain of 1 and a panning of -1. The
            arguments all relate to the names of keyword arguments used by
            FoxDot.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Other information</strong></p>

        <p>
            If you are getting this error –
            <code
                >FoxDot.lib.OSC3.OSCClientError: while sending: [Errno 111]
                Connection refused</code
            >
            then please check your network connection settings are correct. On
            Windows this will be ignored but MacOS and Linux will throw this
            error every time you want to play a note.
